    "why": "In 2016, opioid-related overdoses accounted for more than 42,000 deaths in the United States. Of those, 40% involved prescription opioids. Literature suggests that long-term opioid use often begins with the treatment of acute pain, and a relationship exists between early prescribing patterns and long-term use of opioids. Continued opioid use for noncancer pain is associated with increased risk of opioid use disorder, opioid-related overdose, hospitalization and opioid overdose-related mortality.Studies find a consistent link between increasing days’ supply of the first prescription with probability of continued opioid use, and the rate of opioid use at 1 year post-initial prescription increases substantially for patients with 31 or more days of opioid therapy. This measure is intended to identify a population that is at risk for opioid overuse and misuse who may benefit from additional monitoring, services or support.",

It also exposes patients to unnecessary harms such as radiation and further unnecessary treatment. For the majority of individuals who experience severe low back pain, pain improves within the first two weeks of onset.Avoiding imaging for patients when there is no indication of an underlying condition can prevent unnecessary harm and unintended consequences to patients and can reduce health care costs.",

A gap in treatment currently exists: Estimates suggest that less than 40% of U.S. residents over 12 with an OUD diagnosis receive pharmacotherapy. Encouraging pharmacotherapy is critical because individuals with OUD who engage in treatment with pharmacotherapy are less likely to exhibit withdrawal or craving symptoms and use illicit opioids, and are more likely to remain in treatment and engage in mental health therapy.",

Literature suggests there is a correlation between high dosages of prescription opioids and the risk of both fatal and nonfatal overdose.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline on opioid prescribing for chronic, nonmalignant pain recommends the use of 'additional precautions' when prescribing dosages ≥50 morphine equivalent dose (MED) and recommends providers avoid or 'carefully justify' increasing dosages ≥90 mg MED.In 2019, the authors of the 2016 guidelines published commentary that cautioned providers, systems, payers and states from developing policies and practices that are “inconsistent with and go beyond” the guideline recommendations.6 The commentary included cautions regarding strict enforcement of dosage and duration thresholds, as well as abrupt tapering of opioids. The opioid dosage assessed in this measure is a reference point for health plans to identify members who may be at high risk for opioid overuse and misuse.",

    "why": "In 2016, opioid-related overdoses accounted for more than 42,000 deaths in the United States.1 Of those, 40% involved prescription opioids. Literature suggests there is a correlation between high dosages of prescription opioids and the risk of both fatal and nonfatal overdose.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline on opioid prescribing for chronic, nonmalignant pain recommends the use of 'additional precautions' when prescribing dosages ≥50 morphine equivalent dose (MED) and recommends providers avoid or 'carefully justify' increasing dosages ≥90 mg MED.In 2019, the authors of the 2016 guidelines published commentary that cautioned providers, systems, payers and states from developing policies and practices that are “inconsistent with and go beyond” the guideline recommendations.6 The commentary included cautions regarding strict enforcement of dosage and duration thresholds, as well as abrupt tapering of opioids. The opioid dosage assessed in this measure is a reference point for health plans to identify members who may be at high risk for opioid overuse and misuse.",

    "why": "In 2016, opioid-related overdoses accounted for more than 42,000 deaths in the United States.1 Of those, 40% involved prescription opioids. One area of risk related to opioid use is receipt of opioid prescriptions from multiple prescribers and pharmacies. Studies show that individuals who receive opioids from four or more prescribers or pharmacies have a higher likelihood of opioid-related overdose death than those who receive opioids from one prescriber or one physician. Evidence suggests that people who see multiple prescribers and use multiple pharmacies are at higher risk of overdose.This measure provides health plans with a tool to identify members who may be at high risk for opioid overuse and misuse.",

    "why": "In 2016, opioid-related overdoses accounted for more than 42,000 deaths in the United States. Of those, 40% involved prescription opioids. Literature suggests that long-term opioid use often begins with the treatment of acute pain, and a relationship exists between early prescribing patterns and long-term use of opioids. Continued opioid use for noncancer pain is associated with increased risk of opioid use disorder, opioid-related overdose, hospitalization and opioid overdose-related mortality.Studies find a consistent link between increasing days’ supply of the first prescription with probability of continued opioid use, and the rate of opioid use at 1 year post-initial prescription increases substantially for patients with 31 or more days of opioid therapy. This measure is intended to identify a population that is at risk for opioid overuse and misuse who may benefit from additional monitoring, services or support.",

In any three-month period, approximately 25% of Americans will experience at least one day of back pain.Evidence shows that unnecessary or routine imaging (X-ray, MRI, CT scans) for low back pain is not associated with improved outcomes. It also exposes patients to unnecessary harms such as radiation and further unnecessary treatment. For the majority of individuals who experience severe low back pain, pain improves within the first two weeks of onset.Avoiding imaging for patients when there is no indication of an underlying condition can prevent unnecessary harm and unintended consequences to patients and can reduce health care costs.",
